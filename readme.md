## The stack

**Svelte**: I decided to try a new web framework for the fun of it. Functionally, it feels very similar to Vue. However, it's a complied framework, which means that the deployed bundle should theoretically be smaller.

**TailWindCSS**: The css framework I used, it looks decent.

**Frappe Charts**: Very awesome library for making graphs.

## About

There is significantly less technical details to be discussed on the frontend, most of it is just writing rest requests and updating the dom to display the info.

I did pull in a router so it'll be easier to add in more pages in the future.
